title: "Vulnerability Management"
---

`**Vulnerability** >> A weakness or flaw in a system, process or person, which can be exploited and cause harm.

Types: 
`Misconfigurations/Weak configurations`   insecure protocols, open ports, weak encryption.

`Application Flaws` BOF, DLL Injection, Race Conditions, Improper Error/Input Handling, Memory Leaks.

`Poor Patch Management` Unpatched Servers - Firmware - OS - Appllications

`Design Flaws` Incorrect encryption, Poor validation of data.

`OS Flaws` 

`Default Passwords`

`Zero Day Vulnerabilities` No patch available

`Legacy Platform Vulnerabilities` unsupported assets such as smarphones, computers, IoT, DBs, firewalls, IDSes, etc.

`System Sprawl` Undocumented assets which are not maintained.

`3rd party` vendor management, supply chain.


**Vulnerability management** - the process of identifying, classifying, prioritizing, and mitigating vulnerabilities for keeping systems and networks secure.

In case of a Zero-Day discovery:

```bash 

1. Perform assesment to determine impacted assets;
2. Notify relevant stakeholders;
3. Asses and determine the severity of the vulnerability based on which you set a risk score or damage impact. 
4. Implement temporary measures. isolate affected systems, deactivate services/features, or implement temporary compesanting controls. 
5. Continously monitor the systems for any suspicious activity that could indicate an attack or exploitation of the vulnerability.
```

# OWASP Top 10 - 2021

The OWASP Top 10 is a list of the 10 most critical web application security risks. Here are the issues along with their remediation techniques:

## 1. **Injection**
   - **Description:** Injection flaws occur when an application sends untrusted data to an interpreter.
   - **Remediation:**
     - Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for database access.
     - Employ positive input validation.

## 2. **Broken Authentication**
   - **Description:** Broken authentication vulnerabilities involve improper implementation of authentication and session management.
   - **Remediation:**
     - Implement multi-factor authentication.
     - Use secure password storage mechanisms.
     - Regularly update credentials.

## 3. **Sensitive Data Exposure**
   - **Description:** This occurs when sensitive information is not adequately protected.
   - **Remediation:**
     - Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest.
     - Use strong, up-to-date algorithms for encryption.
     - Regularly audit and monitor access to sensitive data.

## 4. **XML External Entities (XXE)**
   - **Description:** XXE vulnerabilities arise when an application processes XML input.
   - **Remediation:**
     - Disable XML external entity and document type definition processing.
     - Use a secure XML parser.

## 5. **Broken Access Control**
   - **Description:** This issue occurs when restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do are not properly enforced.
   - **Remediation:**
     - Implement proper access controls and authorization checks.
     - Regularly review and update access control policies.

## 6. **Security Misconfigurations**
   - **Description:** Security misconfigurations happen when security settings are not defined and implemented properly.
   - **Remediation:**
     - Regularly review and update security configurations.
     - Use automated tools to identify and remediate misconfigurations.

## 7. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
   - **Description:** XSS vulnerabilities enable attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
   - **Remediation:**
     - Use secure coding practices.
     - Implement output encoding.
     - Employ Content Security Policy (CSP).

## 8. **Insecure Deserialization**
   - **Description:** Insecure deserialization vulnerabilities can lead to remote code execution.
   - **Remediation:**
     - Avoid using serialized objects from untrusted sources.
     - Implement proper validation of serialized objects.

## 9. **Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities**
   - **Description:** This occurs when an application uses outdated or insecure third-party components.
   - **Remediation:**
     - Regularly update and patch all components.
     - Use a software composition analysis tool.

## 10. **Insufficient Logging and Monitoring**
   - **Description:** This involves insufficient visibility into security events and incidents.
   - **Remediation:**
     - Implement comprehensive logging.
     - Regularly monitor and analyze logs for security events.
     - Establish an incident response plan.
