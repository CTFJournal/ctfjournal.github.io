# Welcome to my blog

This is my first blog post using Jekyll. It's super easy to use and looks great out of the box!

## Adding an image

Here's an example of how you can add an image to your blog post:

![My Image](/assets/images/my-image.png)

![My Image](/assets/images/my-image2.png)

That's it for now. Thanks for reading!
