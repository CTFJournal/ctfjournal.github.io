***In this [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/room/snortchallenges1) room we'll put our snort skills into practice for defending against a live attack.***

 

---------------------

Snort is an open-source network intrusion detection system (NIDS) and network intrusion prevention system (NIPS) which can be used to monitor real-time network traffic through packet sniffing, employ a rule-based language for signature-based detection of known threats, conduct protocol analysis across various network protocols, and leverage active response mechanisms to enhance overall network security.
