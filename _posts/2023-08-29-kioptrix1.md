***This room is all about finding ways to pwn the Kioptrix1 machine from [VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/kioptrix-level-1-1,22/) as part of the preparation for PNPT.***


---------------------


We're not going to stop at how to setup the machine on Vmware or Virtualbox, that's an easy task to accomplish. Once set up, there's couple of methods i use to find the ip address. 
```markdown 
1. From the kioptrix machine, ping something - the result will also display the local machine IP.
2. Use "Netdiscover" or "Nmap" on the kali machine to find the hosts on the local network and determine which one is Kioptrix. 
``` 
As we most of the times do, let's start scanning with **nmap**.   I recently learned in the [*Ethical Hacker*](https://skillsforall.com/course/ethical-hacker?courseLang=en-US) course from **Cisco** that using stealth(**-sS**) scan is actually faster than a default TCP Connect(**-sT**), as it doesn't fully complete the 3-way handshake

There's a lot to digest from the nmap scan results, we'll take it step by step, as probably there are multiple ways to compromise this machine.

#### HTTP/S Enumeration. 


Looking at the website itself and viewing the source, does not reveal any info we might use as an initial vector for gaining accesss, hence i jumped to using an **nmap** script first and see what we can reveal

We see some directories discovered. Under **/manual/** there's a "mod" directory containing additional stuff which i do not know what that is yet, i'll probably return to it later.

Looking in **/usage/** directory, we see a dashboard indicating Usage Statistics which is generated with **Webalizer**
