### Reconnaissance

Let's run the nmap scan & see what we can discover. Using the script scan **-sC** & version detection **-sV** we should get the responses for the first 3 questions.

The **nmap** scan results are showing we have **http** & **ssh** open. There's not muchwe can do with **ssh** at this point so let's scan for hidden directories on the web server using **gobuster**

Here is a breakdown of the command:

    gobuster dir : This is the command to start Gobuster in directory mode.
    --url http://10.10.40.62 : This specifies the target URL that Gobuster will search.
    -w /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt : This specifies the wordlist that Gobuster will use to search for directories.
    -t 150 : This specifies the number of threads that Gobuster will use to search for directories. In this case, it's using 150 threads.




We find couple of interesting locations: **/panel** & **/uploads**
