***This is a step by step walkthrough for CTF style [TryHackMe](https://www.tryhackme.com/room/rrootme) room "RootMe"***




---------------------





*First connect to TryHackMe network and deploy the machine. If you don't know how to do this, check this [guide](https://ctfjournal.github.io/Connect-to-TryHackMe-VPN/).*








### Reconnaissance

Let's run the nmap scan & see what we can discover. Using the script scan **-sC** & version detection **-sV** we should get the responses for the first 3 questions.

The **nmap** scan results are showing we have **http** & **ssh** open. There's not much we can do with **ssh** at this point. Looking at the website & page source, we find nothing interesting, so let's scan for hidden directories on the web server using **gobuster**

![img2](/assets/images/root_me/img2.png)


Here is a breakdown of the command:

    gobuster dir : This is the command to start Gobuster in directory mode.
    --url http://10.10.40.62 : This specifies the target URL that Gobuster will search.
    -w /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt : This specifies the wordlist that Gobuster will use to search for directories.
    -t 150 : This specifies the number of threads that Gobuster will use to search for directories. You can tweak this to speed up the scan.


-----------------------------


### Getting a shell 



As a result of the gobuster scan we find couple of interesting locations: **/panel** & **/uploads**. 
Accessing **/panel** we see this is a page where we can upload stuff,  and most likely we will be able to retrieve everything that's being uploaded, at **/uploads** page.

With this in mind we can upload a reverse shell. The **Wappalyzer** extension is indicationg the site is using PHP so i will be going for the well known [PentestMonkey](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php) php reverse shell.

Copy the content from Github and create your file, give it the name as *filename.php* and make sure to update the IP address with the one of your kali machine. Also remember the **port** used.

I attempted to upload as **.php** but it seems we have an upload filter which does not allow **.php** extension. Tried few other extensions and eventually worked to upload as **.php5**

Started the netcat listener on the local **kali** machine and on the webserver clicked on the reverse shell i uploaded earlier. We now have a reverse connection as low priviledged user www-data

Performed a quick search for the **user.txt** file and found it in **/var/www/**.  Looking at the file content we can see the flag.

------------------------------------------



### Privilege escalation

Final task is to escalate privileges to **root** so we can find the root flag. 

Room guidance makes it clear that there's a file with SUID permission which could be a potential privilege escalation vector. Let's look it up. 


![img7](/assets/images/root_me/img7.png)

Here's the command breakdown:

    find: command to search for files and directories
    /: search in root directory & subdirectories
    -type f: search for files only
    -perm -u=s: only look for files with the setuid bit set 
    2>/dev/null: redirects any error messages to /dev/null, effectively suppressing them

Search results are showing that **python** can be executed with **suid** permissions. We can find the privilege escalation method at [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/python/#suid)


![img8](/assets/images/root_me/img8.png)

Executing the command, we escalate privileges to **root** and we can read the content of the *root.txt* to find the flag.

We have completed the room. I hope you found this guide useful.
