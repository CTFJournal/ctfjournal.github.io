***Welcome to "Basic Pentesting" on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/room/basicpentestingjt). The room is focused on teaching web app testing and privilege escalation.***

  Practice: *brute forcing, hash cracking, service enumeration, Linux enumeration* 

---------------------





*First connect to TryHackMe network and deploy the machine. If you need help, check this [guide](https://ctfjournal.github.io/Connect-to-TryHackMe-VPN/).*

--------------------------


As usual, let's start witn an **nmap** scan to see what open ports available services we have.

**Command:** ***nmap -sT -sV -p- --open $IP***

    -sT: TCP connect scan
    -sV: version detection on open ports
    -p-: scan all ports
    --open: show only open ports
    $IP: a variable representing the IP address

The scan reveals open ports for services such as **ssh, http, samba**, etc. Our focus however will stay on the **http** port **80**

Checking the website's main page we get an "Undergoing maintenance" message. Viewing the page source, we see there's a reference to **dev** section. Thought of probability of **/dev** being a hidden directory, but no luck.

Let's scan for hidden content with **wfuzz**

**Command: wfuzz -c -z file,/usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-large-directories.txt --hc 404 "$URL"**

Here's the breakdown of the command

    -c option enables colorized output.
    -z file option specifies a wordlist file for fuzzing.
    /opt/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-large-directories.txt is the wordlist file path.
    --hc 404 option specifies to ignore output for HTTP status code 404.
    "$URL" is the target web server URL variable i set earlier.

The scan reveals a hidden directory  "**/development**"
